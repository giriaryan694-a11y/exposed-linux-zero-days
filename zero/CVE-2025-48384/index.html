    <h1>CVE-2025-48384</h1>
    <h2>Arbitrary File Write in Git During Repository Cloning with Submodules</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
        CVE-2025-48384 is a critical arbitrary file write vulnerability in <strong>Git</strong>, the distributed version control system.
        The flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on a victim's machine during the cloning of repositories with submodules.
        This vulnerability is actively exploited in the wild and has been added to CISA’s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog.
    </p>
    <p>
        The vulnerability is rated <strong>8.1 CVSS</strong> and affects macOS and Linux systems. Windows systems are not impacted due to differences in control character usage.
    </p>

    <h3>Technical Details</h3>
    <p>
        The vulnerability stems from Git’s mishandling of carriage return (`\r`) characters in configuration files.
        A mismatch between how Git writes and reads these characters causes incorrect submodule path resolution.
        Attackers can exploit this issue by publishing repositories with submodules ending in `\r` and a crafted symlink with a malicious hook setup, leading to arbitrary code execution.
    </p>

    <h4>Vulnerable Code Path</h4>
    <p>
        When cloning a repository with the `--recursive` flag, Git processes submodules and resolves their paths.
        If a submodule path contains a carriage return, Git may incorrectly resolve the path, allowing an attacker to write files outside the intended directory structure.
        This can be abused to overwrite sensitive files or plant malicious hooks in the `.git/hooks` directory.
    </p>

    <h3>Impact</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Arbitrary Code Execution:</strong> Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the victim’s machine by crafting malicious repositories.</li>
        <li><strong>Unauthorized File Overwrite:</strong> Sensitive files can be overwritten, leading to system compromise or data loss.</li>
        <li><strong>Supply Chain Attacks:</strong> Malicious repositories can be used to target developers and CI/CD pipelines.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Patch and Mitigation</h3>
    <p>
        The vulnerability has been patched in the latest versions of Git. Users are strongly advised to update immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Mitigation Steps:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Update Git to the latest version available from your distribution or the official Git website.</li>
        <li>Avoid cloning repositories from untrusted sources, especially with the `--recursive` flag.</li>
        <li>Use `git config --global protocol.file.allow user` to restrict file protocol access.</li>
        <li>Monitor CI/CD pipelines for unexpected file changes or execution of untrusted scripts.</li>
        <li>Audit cloned repositories for suspicious submodule paths or hooks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Exploitation in the Wild</h3>
    <p>
        CVE-2025-48384 is actively exploited in targeted attacks. Attackers publish malicious repositories that, when cloned, lead to remote code execution on the victim’s machine.
        CISA has issued a directive for federal agencies to patch this vulnerability by September 15, 2025, and strongly urges all organizations to prioritize remediation.
