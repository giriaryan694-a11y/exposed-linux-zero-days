    <h1>CVE-2024-53104</h1>
    <h2>Linux Kernel Out-of-Bounds Write Vulnerability</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
        CVE-2024-53104 is a critical out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the <strong>Linux kernel</strong>, specifically in the <strong>UVC video</strong> component.
        This flaw allows local attackers to escalate their privileges to root, giving them full control over the affected system.
        The vulnerability has been added to the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s (CISA) Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog based on evidence of active exploitation.
    </p>
    <p>
        The vulnerability is rated <strong>High</strong> and is considered a zero-day, as it was exploited in the wild before a patch was publicly available.
        It affects a wide range of Linux distributions and devices, including Android systems.
    </p>

    <h3>Technical Details</h3>
    <p>
        The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of <strong>UVC_VS_UNDEFINED</strong> frames in the <code>uvc_parse_format</code> function.
        When parsing frames of this type, the kernel does not account for their size in the buffer allocation, leading to an out-of-bounds write.
        This can be exploited to corrupt kernel memory and achieve privilege escalation.
    </p>

    <h4>Vulnerable Code Path</h4>
    <p>
        The flaw occurs in the <code>uvc_parse_format</code> function, which is responsible for parsing video formats in the UVC (USB Video Class) driver.
        The function does not properly validate or handle frames of type <code>UVC_VS_UNDEFINED</code>, leading to a buffer overflow when calculating the size of the frames buffer.
        Attackers can craft malicious UVC device descriptors to trigger the vulnerability and execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.
    </p>

    <h3>Impact</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Privilege Escalation:</strong> Local attackers can escalate their privileges to root, gaining full control over the system.</li>
        <li><strong>Arbitrary Code Execution:</strong> Attackers can execute arbitrary code with kernel-level privileges.</li>
        <li><strong>System Compromise:</strong> Full compromise of the affected machine, including access to sensitive data and system resources.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Patch and Mitigation</h3>
    <p>
        The vulnerability has been patched in the latest versions of the Linux kernel.
        The fix involves skipping the parsing of <code>UVC_VS_UNDEFINED</code> frames in the <code>uvc_parse_format</code> function.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Mitigation Steps:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Update your Linux kernel to the latest version provided by your distribution.</li>
        <li>Apply security patches as soon as they are available.</li>
        <li>Restrict physical and logical access to systems to prevent unauthorized USB device connections.</li>
        <li>Monitor system logs for unusual activity related to UVC devices or video drivers.</li>
        <li>Use security tools to detect and prevent privilege escalation attempts.</li>
    </ul>
