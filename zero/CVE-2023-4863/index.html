    <h1>CVE-2023-4863</h1>
    <h2>Buffer Overflow in libwebp</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
        CVE-2023-4863 is a critical buffer overflow vulnerability in the <strong>libwebp</strong> library, which is widely used for WebP image processing.
        This flaw affects a variety of software products, including web browsers such as Chrome and Firefox, as well as applications like Microsoft Teams.
        The vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to achieve remote code execution (RCE) without requiring user interaction.
    </p>
    <p>
        CVE-2023-4863 is rated <strong>Critical</strong> and was actively exploited in the wild.
        It was disclosed in October 2023 and affects a wide range of platforms and applications that use the libwebp library for image processing.
    </p>

    <h3>Technical Details</h3>
    <p>
        The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the libwebp library, which is used to process WebP images.
        The flaw occurs due to improper bounds checking when processing maliciously crafted WebP images, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.
        This can be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the target system.
    </p>

    <h4>Vulnerable Code Path</h4>
    <p>
        The buffer overflow occurs in the WebP image decoding process.
        When a maliciously crafted WebP image is processed, the library fails to properly validate the image dimensions and data, leading to a buffer overflow.
        Attackers can exploit this to overwrite memory and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application processing the image.
    </p>
    <p>
        The vulnerability can be triggered by simply opening or processing a malicious WebP image, making it highly dangerous for applications that automatically process images, such as web browsers and messaging apps.
    </p>

    <h3>Impact</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Remote Code Execution:</strong> Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the target system by tricking users into processing a malicious WebP image.</li>
        <li><strong>System Compromise:</strong> Full compromise of the affected application and potentially the entire system.</li>
        <li><strong>Unauthorized Access:</strong> Attackers can gain access to sensitive data and system resources.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Patch and Mitigation</h3>
    <p>
        The vulnerability has been patched in the latest versions of libwebp and affected software.
        Users are strongly advised to update their software immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Mitigation Steps:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Update libwebp and all affected software (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Teams) to the latest versions.</li>
        <li>Avoid opening or processing WebP images from untrusted sources.</li>
        <li>Use security tools to scan for and block malicious images.</li>
        <li>Monitor system logs for unusual activity related to image processing or application crashes.</li>
        <li>Apply security patches for your operating system and applications as soon as they are available.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Exploitation in the Wild</h3>
    <p>
        CVE-2023-4863 was actively exploited in the wild, targeting users through malicious WebP images.
        The vulnerability was used in attacks to achieve remote code execution on affected systems, including web browsers and messaging applications.
        Google and other vendors released emergency patches to address the issue and protect users from exploitation.
